# ResetMainStory

I made this mod because I failed the main quest by taking too long. The mod resets the main quest back to the beginning.

## Usage
1) Backup your saves.
2) Seriously, back them up. This modifies your save file and isn't well tested. It could permanently break it.
3) Activate the mod.
4) Load your save.
4) Save your game.
5) Exit the game.
6) Deactivate the mod.
7) Load your save.

If you don't unload the mod, it'll reset the main quest every time you load.
